To use this extenstion, add -exts=/path/to/lcdnotify.pl and -notifytype=lcdnotify
to either your start script, or to your .ttytterrc file.

This will intialize the LCD screen on startup and show a test pattern.

Default behaviour is to output all tweets that would show up in your feed to the screen -
this can be modified by adding '-notifies=(options)' where options are any of:
   me, default, reply, dm
This will cause only those tweets to show up on the screen.

The LCD assumes a 20x4 LCD screen and will format the incoming tweets to show
username of the tweet in the title bar at top, the first 20 characters of the tweet
on ine 2, the next 20 characters on line three, and the remaining on line 4 as a scroller
type. The script will not split a word on line 3 - instead the complete word will move to line 4
for ease of reading.

If you have any questions or comments - feel free to hit me up on twitter at @shockwaver.
